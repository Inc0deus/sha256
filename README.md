# sha256 implementation

This is a one header implementation of the sha256 hash function in C++.
The code was not made to be particularly fast and is not intended for real use cases. It was only made for learning purposes.

The main function is "hash265", it takes a string (unicode characters) and return another string (hexadecimal characters - 0123456789abcdef).
The file "example.cpp" shows how it could be used.
